# PoissonExposureSimulator

The concept is simple. 

Take an image (expected), samples every pixel several times (exposure) and take the average (normalization).
The more times you sample, the result should be more similar to the image you offer. 

The expected image can be generated by starSimulator, or custom by using readImage.
starSimulator approximates the effect of atmospheric disturbance with Gaussian distribution.

Now it's time to take some exposures of the expected image!
The method of sampling is Poisson sampling.
