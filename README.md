# PoissonExposureSimulator

The concept is simple. 

Take an image (expected), samples every pixel several times (exposure) and take the average (normalization).<br>
The more times you sample, the result should be similar to the image you offer. 

The expected image can be generated by starSimulator, or custom by using readImage.<br>
starSimulator approximates the effect of atmospheric disturbance with Gaussian distribution.

Now it's time to take some exposures of the expected image!<br>
The method of sampling is Poisson sampling.
